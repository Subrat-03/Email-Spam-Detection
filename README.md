# FEATURES:
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming
Feature Extraction: TF-IDF or Bag of Words
Machine Learning Models: NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.
Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
Jupyter Notebook Implementation for easy experimentation


# DATASET:
The dataset used for training and testing is stored in mail_data.csv.
Contains labeled emails as Spam (1) or Not Spam (0).


# MODEL PERFORMANCE:
